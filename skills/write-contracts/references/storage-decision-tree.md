# Storage Type Decision Tree

## When to Use This

User mentions: "store", "save", "track", "registry", "mapping", "collection", "list"

## Decision Questions

### Q1: Access Pattern

**Ask:** "What's your access pattern?"

- **Sequential access** (iterate through items in order)
  → Vector (if <100) or SmartVector (if 100+)

- **Key-value lookups** (find item by key/address)
  → Table (unordered) or OrderedMap/BigOrderedMap (sorted)

- **Both** (ordered iteration + key lookup)
  → OrderedMap (<100) or BigOrderedMap (100+)

### Q2: Expected Size

**Ask:** "What's the expected data size?"

- **Small & bounded** (<100 items)
  → Vector or OrderedMap

- **Large or unbounded** (100s-1000s items)
  → SmartVector, Table, or BigOrderedMap

- **Unknown/unpredictable**
  → SmartVector or BigOrderedMap (safest, grows dynamically)

### Q3: Length Tracking (Conditional)

**Ask only if size matters:** "Do you need to track the total count?"

- **Yes, need `.length()`**
  → TableWithLength, OrderedMap, Vector, SmartVector

- **No, don't need count**
  → Table or BigOrderedMap

## Common Patterns Quick Reference

| User Says                 | Access Pattern    | Size       | Recommended Storage             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| "track users"             | Key-value         | Unbounded  | `Table<address, UserInfo>`      |
| "staking records"         | Key-value         | Unbounded  | `Table<address, StakeInfo>`     |
| "leaderboard"             | Ordered + lookup  | Unbounded  | `BigOrderedMap<u64, address>`   |
| "transaction log"         | Sequential        | 100+       | `SmartVector<TxRecord>`         |
| "whitelist"               | Sequential        | <100       | `Vector<address>`               |
| "voting records"          | Key-value + count | Unbounded  | `TableWithLength<address, bool>`|
| "config mappings"         | Ordered + lookup  | <50        | `OrderedMap<String, Value>`     |
| "DAO proposals"           | Ordered + lookup  | Unbounded  | `BigOrderedMap<u64, Proposal>`  |
| "user NFT collection"     | Sequential        | Varies     | `Vector<Object<T>>` or `SmartVector<Object<T>>` |

## Recommendation Format

Always recommend explicitly with this format:

**"For [pattern], I recommend `[Type]<K, V>` because [reason] ([gas context])"**

**Examples:**

1. **Staking records:**
   "For staking records, I recommend `Table<address, StakeInfo>` because you'll have unbounded users with concurrent staking operations (separate slots enable parallel access with per-slot gas cost)"

2. **Leaderboard:**
   "For leaderboard, I recommend `BigOrderedMap<u64, address>` because you need sorted iteration for top N players (O(log n) operations, use allocate_spare_slots for production to ensure predictable gas)"

3. **Transaction log:**
   "For transaction logs, I recommend `SmartVector<TransactionRecord>` because you need chronological append-only storage for 100+ transactions (bucket-based storage reduces gas for large datasets)"

4. **Whitelist:**
   "For whitelist, I recommend `Vector<address>` because you have a small bounded list (<100 addresses) where O(n) lookup is acceptable (most efficient for small sequential data)"

## Important Notes

- **NEVER use SmartTable** (deprecated, replaced by BigOrderedMap)
- **Vector cutoff:** Use Vector for <100 items, SmartVector for 100+
- **OrderedMap cutoff:** Use OrderedMap for <100 items, BigOrderedMap for 100+
- **Production:** For BigOrderedMap, mention `allocate_spare_slots` configuration for predictable gas
- **Gas context:** Keep to one line, focus on functional benefits first
